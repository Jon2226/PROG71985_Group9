To-do
	-- display events between two arbitrary dates
	-- add escape characters to for user to back out of ALL input menus
	-- add event end time, and/or duration
	-- check for schedule conflicts when adding an event, and ask user to confirm or change the time
	-- test/refactor for DST and different timezones compatability

	-- revise search algorithm to continue to the end of the list every time and collect all results at once (by storing them in a second list): this will be much more efficient than re-searching the entire list until we reach the end

	-- fuzzy search
		-- case-insensitive
		-- write a containsWord() function using strtok to search for event with just one word of the description
		-- more complex algorithms?

	-- make an enumerated array of function pointers for different search methods in the search/range menu switch statements... partly to make those functions leaner and more readable, but mostly because function pointers are cool

	-- allow user to define custom event type names
	-- look at iCal format and consider feasability of import/export

-- learn ncurses to make the I/O way cooler
-- use a GUI library to... just kidding, CLI > GUI
