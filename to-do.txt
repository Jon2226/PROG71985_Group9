To-do (unsorted)

	-- properly create/implement recurring events
	-- improve formatting of remaining time display
	-- add function to call strtok and convert input to int, for code readability/reusability
	-- replace use of \t with something more portable (since tab widths will differ by what runs the program)
	-- move 'menu' functions to separate component from 'interface' so it's less cluttered
	-- enum for menu options, or use letters
	-- add escape characters to for user to back out of ALL input menus
	-- implement end time for events, and/or duration
		-- check for schedule conflicts when adding an event, and ask user to confirm or change the time
	-- test/refactor for DST and different timezones compatability
	-- possibly refactor the whole project to rename EVENT, since it turns out Microsoft very annoyingly defines 'event' as a keyword in the .NET framework (which leads to non-standard syntax highlighting in Visual Studio, and potentially a lot of confusion)
		-- for now, variables have been renamed 
	-- display for week in tabular format (Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun) with events listed below each day

	-- make an enumerated array of function pointers for different search methods used in the search/range menu (i.e. to replace the switch statements, to make those menu functions leaner and more readable)

	-- revise search algorithm to continue to the end of the list every time and collect all results at once (by storing them in a second list): this will be much more efficient than re-searching the entire list until we reach the end

	-- fuzzy search
		-- case-insensitive
		-- write a containsWord() function using strtok to search for event with just one word of the description
		-- more complex algorithms?

	-- allow user to define custom event type names
	-- look at iCal format and consider feasability of import/export

-- learn ncurses to make the I/O way cooler
