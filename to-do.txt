To-do
	-- lots of testing
	-- fix strtok usage to properly parse dates/times and accept/reject values appropriately so we don't need scanf
	-- properly create/implement recurring events
	-- improve formatting of remaining time display
	-- organize printed events chronologically (by calling qsort with pointer to time and date comparison function)
	-- print number of results from a search
	-- move 'menu' functions to separate component from 'interface' so it's less cluttered
	-- enum for menu options and convert input to integer (readability)
	-- come up with a more stable solution for uniquely identifying events than the global eventIndex variable 
			-- (which would be a static int in either the addEventToList() or createEvent() function, but it also needs to be initialized/reset when loading files)

	-- add escape characters to for user to back out of ALL input menus
	-- implement end time for events, and/or duration
			-- check for schedule conflicts when adding an event, and ask user to confirm or change the time
	-- test/refactor for DST and different timezones compatability
	-- display for week in tabular format (Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun) with events listed below each day
	-- display for month/year in calendar format (like Unix cal command, but with an asterisk (*) or other marker for days that have events

	-- make an enumerated array of function pointers for different search methods used in the search/range menu (i.e. to replace the switch statements, to make those menu functions leaner and more readable)

	-- revise search algorithm to continue to the end of the list and collect all results at once (by storing results in a secondary list of pointers, instead of returning one result at a time)
			-- this will be much more efficient than re-searching the entire list in a loop until we reach the end

	-- fuzzy search
		-- case-insensitive
		-- write a containsWord() function using strtok to search for event with just one word of the description
		-- more complex algorithms?

	-- allow user to define custom event type names
	-- look at iCal format and consider feasability of import/export
	-- learn ncurses to replace current I/O
