– LINKED LIST OF EVENTS: see classroom example, and assignments 3 and 4


Simple things: 
– get/set functions for members of EVENT struct (using pointers)
– get/set functions for members of TIME struct (using pointers)
    – note: for set functions, check for invalid values and return false if invalid
– create/destroy/copy functions for TIME struct
– switch/case  functions:     getMonthName(TIME* t), getWeekdayName(TIME* t)
    – similar to the switch functions that already exist for other enums


Display functions: 
    – display single event data
    – display all known events
– display a given week (with headings for each day “Mon Tues Wed” etc and any events on that day below)
    – display year (with * next to days for events)
    – display single month (with * next to days for events)
Essentially like this: https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/cal3.png


    – search for an event by type
    – search for an event by day        – display single day and any events


User input: 
– input dates/times: if no value is given, assume current
    – make a new event (incl. repeating events)
    – delete an existing event
    – modify an existing event
